# Rust Electric Circuits
This is a collection of Rust Electrical diagrams that can be used in the game Rust in order to help more securely defend your base.</br>
My goal is to help others that are new to rust electricity or perhaps seasoned players looking for more advanced wiring diagrams.</br>
Feel free to send me a message if you see anything that could be improved on, have questions, or would like me to review something you are working on
